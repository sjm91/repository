What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder with the metadata needed to keep track of the changes of
the current directory is created. I need to do it to create a version
control of the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It is a intermediate step, not to commit accidentally not desired files.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add to the staing area only those modified files that belongs to the
same logical change, so no other is to be commit
