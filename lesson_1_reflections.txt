How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Reduce the number of lines to look for the bug, to those which are more
    likely to contain the bug, reducing the time spent.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Reducing the time to amend a mistake produced in one of the versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros, avoiding uploading not useful information, or not finished changes.
    Cons, depends on the programmer-> it could be forgotten

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because while coding is normal to change multiple files for the same reason,
    therefore is easier to keep track of the change by uploading all the
    affected files, while this is not so common in a text document.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    using git log allows to guess the ids of each of the previous versions of
    the history of the files, using the git diff command plus the id allows to
    see the difference in each version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because since it is easy to recover a previous version of the repository
    you pay less attention not to commit errors.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To keep track of my future projects
